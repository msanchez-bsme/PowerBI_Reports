<h1>Customer Churn Data Analysis Project

<h2> Overview </h2><p>This repository contains a Power BI based data analysis which builds on the case study interactive course available through <a href = "https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/case-study-analyzing-customer-churn-in-power-bi">DataCamp</a>. In this project, Power BI skills are applied to a real-world dataset relating to a subscription-based business whose main objective is to reduce customer churn.</p>
<p>The dataset utilized for this analysis corresponds to Databel, a fictional telecom company who has asked us to analyze thir churn rates. Here, the objective is not only to determine what the company's churn rate is, but to dig into the data and determine probable causes for customer churn and providing insights into actions that can be taken to reduce churn.</p>
